## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of Murmuration seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We follow the principle of [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure). This means we ask security researchers to:

1. Notify us as soon as possible after discovering a potential security issue
2. Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
3. Keep vulnerability details confidential until a patch is released

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or discussions.**

Instead, please email our security team at `security@example.com` with the subject line "[SECURITY] Vulnerability in Murmuration". You should receive a response within 48 hours. If you don't hear back, please follow up via email.

### Required Information

To help us triage and address your report, please include the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Affected versions** of Murmuration
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Impact** of the vulnerability
- **Proof-of-concept** or exploit code (if available)
- **Suggested mitigation** or solution (if known)
- **Your contact information** (optional, for follow-up questions)

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will confirm the existence of the vulnerability and keep you informed of our progress
- We will notify you when the vulnerability has been fixed
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (if you wish)

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

- Never commit API keys or other sensitive information to version control
- Use environment variables or a secure secret management solution
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Follow the principle of least privilege when generating API keys

### Secure Development

- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Use static analysis tools to identify potential security issues
- Follow secure coding practices
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Runtime Security

- Run the application with the minimum required permissions
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Known Security Considerations

### LLM Security

When using LLM providers, be aware of:

- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious input could manipulate the model's behavior
- **Data Leakage**: Sensitive information might be included in model inputs
- **Model Bias**: Models may exhibit biased or harmful behavior

### Network Security

- Always use TLS 1.2+ for all API communications
- Validate SSL certificates
- Be cautious when using self-signed certificates in production

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Log security-relevant events
- Regularly audit access to sensitive data

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions (e.g., 1.2.3 â†’ 1.2.4). We recommend always using the latest stable version of Murmuration.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories will be published in the following locations:
